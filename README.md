- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Mahdi.
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Machine Learning and Deep Learning and their application in various fields and AI for Good in general.
- ğŸ’» I recently interned at Uwear.ai, a MontrÃ©al-based startup where I worked on Multi-modal models as well as Reinforcement Learning for GenerativeAI. I built different models deriving solutions from different papers and state-of-the-art techniques.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently studying Machine Learning at UniversitÃ© de MontrÃ©al as part of MILA. I obtained my bachelor degree in Engineering from McGill University in May 2021.
